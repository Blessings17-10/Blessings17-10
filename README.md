- Hello there, my name is @Blessings17-10
- I am currently interested in topics of philosophy and the creative arts 
- I’m currently learning how to code, so far I have a grasp on basic HTML and CSS but if you're willing to teach me, I'm willing to learn more
- I’m looking to collaborate on any simple html or css document projects to expand my skills but also get to know those who I collaborate with if possible if forming connections is your niche 
- You can contact me privately with this number: +27 8365 0199,  I'm open to chatting with anyone aslong as we can keep it civil
